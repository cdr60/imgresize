# what is this ?
This is Delphi XE source code of my resizer software.
It can resize all images of a subsolder to another one.
It can adjust to max width, to max height to keep the original ratio
You can compile it to windows
It uses standard Delphi library so, it will be easy to compile with another Delphi version or, perhaps with Lazarus
